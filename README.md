## Crytpo Coinnessour 

## Description

Crypto coinnessour is a react application focused on being able to use axios to pull api data from multiple apis, render them, and be able to design a react application based off that data. Crytp Coinnessour grabs crypto currency data and is able to give detailed information on each coin, and look up up to 20,000 different crypto coins. To create this project I utilized React, Axios, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap. 

## Challeneges and Favorite parts

Some Challenges with this code was definitely creating a reactive grid system that will grow and shrink depending on the size of the page. With the grid layout right now the number of rows and columns are adaptable depending on the size of the window that displays the application. Not only that but being able to learn bootstrap and learning basics such as containers, rows, columns, etc was intresting to learn and extremely helpful. My favorite part is without a doubt the search bar, which uses a searching api that will return results dependent on the query presented to the api. Finding out intresting ways to make it work was definitely a fun experience.
